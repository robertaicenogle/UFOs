## Summary
Overall, this is an interactive and attractive way to display the UFO data. One drawback is the limited data set - limited info on the people who actually saw the UFO's. I'd recommend expanding the data set, and adding more columns. I would also recommend somehow enabling ongoing updates that account for future UFO sitings continue to occur.
